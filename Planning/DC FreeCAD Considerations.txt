Overusing the spreadsheet can lead to slowdown in FreeCAD. This document maps out which variables go where.

Unchanging dimensions: These are created within sketcher and will never need to change.
- Switch socket size (x, y, z, overhang.)
- Spacing between switches
- Spacing between columns (20 mm)
- Width of columns (19 mm)
- Thickness of outer rack, arches
- screw hole location from center-row switch - must be the same on every arch for the stagger guide rail to work
- Tenting foot thickness
- Tenting foot footprint (x and y)

Unique dimensions: They should be given variable names, but each is unique.
- Single column tilt
- Per-key  tilt
- Column height
- Column stagger

Spreadsheet values: - these variables apply universally but should be edited by the user.
- Bottom row keycap height
- Z row keycap height
- A row keycap height
- Q row keycap height
- Top row keycap height
- Wiring clearance
- Screw diameter
- Keyboard tenting angle
