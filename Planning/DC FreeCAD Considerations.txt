Overusing the spreadsheet can lead to slowdown in FreeCAD. This document maps out which variables go where.

Unchanging dimensions: These are created within sketcher and will never need to change.
- Switch socket size (x, y, z, overhang.)
- Spacing between switches
- Spacing between columns (20 mm)
- Thickness of components
- screw hole location from center-row switch - must be the same on every arch for the stagger guide rail to work
- Tenting screw diameter

Editable dimensions: These are dimensions that a user would most likely want to edit; they are within the spreadsheet. They should be given variable names.
Whole-column tilt
Per-key relative tilt angle
Column height
Column stagger

Spreadsheet values: - these are typically variables that must be shared between rows AND must be edited by the end user. 
- Bottom row keycap height
- Z row keycap height
- A row keycap height
- Q row keycap height
- Top row keycap height
- Wiring clearance
- Screw diameter
- Keyboard tenting angle
