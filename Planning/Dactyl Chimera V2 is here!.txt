This was my planned reddit post for Dactyl Chimera EX (which was too difficult to print and assemble. It can serve as the template for V3's announcement comment)

If you missed my post on the first Dactyl Chimera:
- Print each column separately and screw everything together, shortening the print time for each component.
- Add 3D printed shims under your model to fine-tune each column's height and stagger after printing.
- View and edit your model directly in 3D space using FreeCAD, rather than searching through lines of code in Clojure.
- Not everything's perfect, of course: this keyboard won't save on plastic, and won't look as polished as a traditional solid-walled Dactyl build. You also shouldn't travel with this board because it isn't as durable.

Dactyl Chimera V2 brings some great new things to your table (or standing desk):
- The rack is split into multiple parts for shorter print times. The original DC's rack took 9 hours to print; now the biggest piece takes just under 4 hours.
- FreeCAD's 3D model is now far less likely to break when adjusted! You can change tenting angle, column tilt, column curve radius, and screw diameter by changing values in a spreadsheet... and this time it ~~won't break your model~~ is less likely to break your model.
- The rack gains an extra inner column for mounting accessories like a microcontroller tray or rotary encoder holder. (you'll have to do the 3D modeling for that on your own, though.)
- The default column height and stagger now match the position or a Dactyl Manuform as per https://dactyl.siskam.link/api so if you don't care about all the technical editing stuff, the regular .stl files should feel great to type on.

There's good news if you printed V1 of the Dactyl Chimera:
- The new adjustable thumb cluster and tenting screws can be attached to DC V1's rack; this will provide most of V2's hardware improvements if your keyboard is already printed out.
- Most of V1 and V2's columns are also interchangeable, but V2's columns are physically quite similar to V1's. The pinky columns are not interchangeable between versions.

But that's not all:
- Dactyl Chimera V2 has an unabridged build guide on GitHub Pages. https://wolficefang.github.io/dactyl-chimera-keyboard/
- Dactyl Chimera V2 has per-key backlighting support, courtesy of WSB. I designed the "World's Smallest Board" to fit into the space between an already-wired hotswap sockets and a keyswitch. It helps you align an RGB LED... and provides literally no other convenience. You can wire your board today and add the RGB next week, if you wanted. I should note that Dactyl Chimera has enough space for full-size single switch PCBs, but not the flexible PCBs designed for a traditional Dactyl.
- There are prewritten templates for using Vial and QMK.

Some things didn't make it into V2, and can be expected in V3:
- Choc switches are not supported (yet.)
- There is still only one type of thumb cluster. I want to add a joystick to this board, but... screwing in different thumb clusters is actually pretty easy and everything else is already done. Trying to actually mount a thumb stick is the difficult part.
- There will be ZMK firmware support, I'm hoping the V3 will be sturdy enough to actually *go* places, but that's very unlikely considering all the exposed wiring.
