# dactyl-chimera-keyboard
A mechanical keyboard designed for 3D printing, tinkering, and experimentation.

This project aims to provide a "test bench" system for trying out various curved columns in mechanical keyboards. Potential side effects include: shorter print times, fine-tuning of column height and stagger, adjustable tenting, and comfortable computer usage. interchangable thumb clusters are a goal of the project, but have not yet been researched.

Dactyl Chimera (DC)'s primary design is as a testing tool. It is not designed to look stylish, sound spectacular, or increase compactness. If you do not mind a couple (dozen) dangling wires or visible screws, DC should offer reliable long-term use, and potentially even hold up to the rigors of PC gaming, although my computer setup (and lifestyle) would be unable to verify such claims.

We (that is, so far, just Wolf Icefang) are developing Dactyl Chimera in FreeCAD and intend to replicate it in SolveSpace. If you prefer a different 3D modeling platform there will be a sizing chart to help you align your columns to the "rack", or bottom plate. If you can't wrap your head around any 3D modeling application, you can download a set of "standard" STL files and just 3D print those at your local library/school/makerspace. However, if you own a 3D printer, I HIGHLY recommend learning to draw in FreeCAD or at the very least, get help in the Dactyl Chimera Center on [Matrix] Element. https://matrix.to/#/!mArixoOlqsCQNWsaFc:matrix.org?via=matrix.org The Dactyl Chimera Center is also a great place to discuss improvements/ideas/concerns about DC, alongside, of course, the Issues and Pull requests panels of this GitHub page.

Wiring up a Dactyl Chimera shouldn't be too different from handwiring a regular Dactyl, and I'll post a link to a good build guide once I find one. For now, here's a link to the more generalized r/mechanicalkeyboards custom keyboards wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/customkeyboards to learn about hardware, and for software, here's a link https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/customkeyboards You'll be using Custom Firmware, most commonly QMK or ZMK.

(Details of what makes the Dactyl Chimera awesome go here, but now it's time for me to eat dinner and further enjoy the Labor Day holiday weekend.)





History of the Dactyl / Special Thanks:
The first [Dactyl keyboard](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard), created by Adareth, is a 3D printable adaptation of the Kinesis Advantage keyboard. The Kinesis Advantage, in turn, bears a striking resemblance to the even older Maltron Keyboard. This Dactyl Chimera also takes inspiration from the bezel-free sides of the [Dactyl Manuform](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard), the adjustability of the [Squeezebox keyboard](https://peterlyons.com/problog/2021/04/squeezebox-keyboard/), the Tenting Puck of the [Kyria](https://splitkb.com/products/tenting-puck) and various discussions on the #kb-ergo channel in the [MechKeys Discord](https://discord.gg/mechkeys)
